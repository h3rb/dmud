# dmud
A MUD written in Processing (www.processing.org) back in 2005.  Now called dMUD, originally released as pMUD.  About the Software  dMUD is a project that began around the end of August, 2005, as an entry into the 32k Mud Competition sponsored by Pizza_Party on mudconnect.com, and would have been written slightly differently had it not be limited to 32k.  All in all, it possesses features that are similar to, but not derived from Aber, Diku and LP mud software. No code included in this software is identical to Diku source, nor is any of it 'borrowed' from either of those software packages.  dMUD runs on any system which supports Java, PHP and MySQL. It requires use of a web server, such as Apache, to serve its content, and the use of a web browser to serve the content through a telnet socket.  The basic structures and classes, aside from game-specific content and constructs, are the core of any MUD written in PHP/MySQL+Processing.  This is a good "starting place" for a Java MUD developer to make an entirely new game.
